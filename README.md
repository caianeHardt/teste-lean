## Description
### StartUp Fintech
Project for online payments. 
Initially we have two types of users on the platform, one who makes payments and the other who just receives. But with the expansion of the product in mind, the project was created to be used on a larger scale. For example, we have a table where we store the types of users and whether or not they can make transfers.


This project was created using nestJs and TypeOrm.
[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.
